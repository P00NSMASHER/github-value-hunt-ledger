# LEARNING MEASUREMENT PRECOMMIT PACKETS

Advisory packets that freeze **what** to measure before execution. They do not activate work, assign a worker, or reveal/choose train versus confirm membership.

- Mode: **precommit_only**
- Policy effect: **none**
- Activates work: **false**
- Requires normal generated assignment/claim: **yes**
- Manual work can complete a packet: **no**
- Partition remains unknown until canonical ingestion.

## Packets

| Packet | Strategy | Phase | Seed | Objective |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Execution boundary

These packets become executable only after the user explicitly resumes hunters and the normal generated assignment/claim path selects the work. Never select, release, retry, or substitute a packet based on its eventual train/confirm partition.
