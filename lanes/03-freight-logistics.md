# Freight & Logistics

## Hunter instructions
Before searching, read this file plus ../MASTER.md, ../REJECTED.md, and ../COMBINATIONS.md.

Search public GitHub repositories for unusually valuable functioning software, data pipelines, algorithms, workflows, datasets, integrations, or product infrastructure relevant to this lane. Include obscure, abandoned, low-star, and no-license repositories in discovery. Respect license/copyright for reuse.

Do not collect, reproduce, preserve, or exploit exposed credentials, personal data, authentication material, or accidentally published confidential information. Skip/quarantine those items and continue searching for legitimate technical or commercial value.

## Findings
### DominicFinn/open_tms
- Repository: https://github.com/DominicFinn/open_tms
- Commit / revision: 93d8c2b8ff78373ff69bb7ea546743e4703628b1
- Date discovered: 2026-09-19
- What it contains: Active TypeScript transport-management platform with React frontend, Fastify backend, Prisma/PostgreSQL, CQRS/event-driven domain modeling, shipment/customer/carrier/order operations, IoT tracking, EDI work, reporting, deployment templates, and a shared TMS/WMS core.
- Why it matters: This is a substantial logistics application substrate rather than a demo. Its current roadmap shows active September 2026 work on EDI ingestion, carrier connectivity, shipment quality, tenancy, reporting, deployment, and WMS separation.
- Commercial possibilities: Base layer for a freight-audit/recovery product, shipper operations portal, carrier performance product, or logistics workflow system when paired with document extraction and audit rules.
- Build-time savings: Very high. It can eliminate much of the commodity work around logistics domain models, API/UI scaffolding, tenancy, deployment, shipment workflows, and carrier/EDI foundations.
- Evidence inspected: README.md; package.json with build/test/lint workspaces; roadmap.md reviewed September 2026 describing EDI inbound, carrier connectivity, reporting, platform hardening, and TMS/WMS split.
- License / rights: MIT.
- Reuse classification: Directly reusable subject to MIT terms.
- Scores:
  - Technical value: High
  - Commercial value: High when combined with a specific ROI product
  - Rarity: Medium-High
  - Completeness: High but still pre-release/active development
  - Build-time saved: Very High
  - Data advantage: Low by itself
  - High-ticket potential: High
- Next action: Inspect shipment/rate/EDI domain models and identify the shortest path to add invoice/rate-contract verification plus evidence-backed exception reporting.

### kodekinetics79/opstrax-enterprise-build
- Repository: https://github.com/kodekinetics79/opstrax-enterprise-build
- Commit / revision: fec2ba1432d6f8b4ba4c48be3d58e7e096819045
- Date discovered: 2026-09-19
- What it contains: A zero-star but production-oriented logistics platform with a particularly deep detention-recovery subsystem. The implemented flow consumes geofence Entry/Exit events through a one-time consumed-event ledger, attributes dwell to the matching job/driver/customer, applies an appointment-aware billable clock using later-of(appointment, arrival), sends pre-expiry notices, resolves customer-vs-tenant rule cards, prices detention fail-closed, stores immutable evidence bundles with SHA-256 linkage, requires AP-style approval before billing, creates exactly one detention job charge, blocks double approval, and exposes shareable evidence packets. The repo also contains PostgreSQL migrations, .NET services, production deployment tooling, and integration tests that exercise the real event-to-charge path.
- Why it matters: This is unusually complete domain logic for converting physical-truth telemetry into evidence-grade money recovery. It addresses the hard parts that generic freight-audit products usually lack: bounce/re-entry deduplication, appointment anchoring, evidence provenance, notice timing, fail-closed pricing, claim-window constraints, approval gates, and idempotent billing. That architecture could materially strengthen a freight-invoice audit/recovery product by validating detention/accessorial charges against physical evidence instead of trusting invoice text alone.
- Commercial possibilities: Clean-room blueprint for an evidence-backed detention recovery module sold to carriers/brokers on contingency or shared savings; or, inverted for shippers, a detention/accessorial validation layer that verifies whether billed detention is supported by geofence, appointment, notice, and rule-card evidence before payment. The evidence-share packet could also support dispute automation and recovery workflows.
- Build-time savings: High even without code reuse. The inspected implementation/test suite collapses months of domain discovery around event pairing, pricing state machines, notice requirements, evidence hashing, approval controls, and dispute-ready artifacts; estimated 3-6 months of clean-room design/edge-case work for a focused detention module.
- Evidence inspected: Repository metadata and latest main commit; `backend-dotnet/Services/DetentionService.cs` showing consumed-event-ledger semantics, job attribution, later-of appointment/arrival clocking, pre-expiry notices, rule-card selection, fail-closed pricing, rounding and caps; `backend-dotnet.Tests/DetentionApprovalPostgresTests.cs` exercising the real geofence-event -> dwell -> price -> approval pipeline, immutable evidence SHA linkage, double-approve prevention, missing-reference gate, audited override, public share token, and recovery funnel; detention schema migration/search evidence; deployment helper commit. No secrets or private data were collected.
- License / rights: No `LICENSE` file at the inspected revision (GitHub contents lookup returned 404; repository metadata reports no license). Copyrighted source is therefore inspect/learn only unless permission is later established.
- Reuse classification: Inspect / learn / clean-room implementation only.
- Scores:
  - Technical value: 9.5/10
  - Commercial value: 9.3/10
  - Rarity: 9.6/10
  - Completeness: 9.1/10
  - Build-time saved: 8.8/10
  - Data advantage: 9.1/10
  - High-ticket potential: 9.4/10
- Next action: Clean-room implement only the detention evidence core beside the existing freight-audit stack: geofence/dwell evidence schema, appointment-aware clock, rule-card versioning, immutable evidence hash, approval gate, and dispute packet; validate it against synthetic geofence/appointment/invoice cases before any customer pilot.
